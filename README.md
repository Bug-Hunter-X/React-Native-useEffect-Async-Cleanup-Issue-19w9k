# React Native useEffect Async Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and asynchronous operations.  The issue arises when the component unmounts before an asynchronous operation (like a `fetch` call) within `useEffect` completes.  This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using AbortController to gracefully handle cleanup.

## Problem

The original code lacks a proper cleanup mechanism to cancel the asynchronous operation if the component is unmounted before the operation completes.  This results in the operation continuing to run in the background, potentially causing issues.

## Solution

The solution uses `AbortController` to create an abort signal that can be used to cancel the fetch request if the component is unmounted.  This ensures that resources are released properly and prevents unexpected behavior.
